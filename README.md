# Advent of Code 2023 - JavaScript Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges, implemented in JavaScript.

Advent of Code is an annual event that offers a series of programming puzzles for each day of December leading up to Christmas. It's a fun way to improve your problem-solving skills and learn new programming techniques.

## Structure

Each day's solution is organized in its own folder, labeled `day-XX`, where `XX` represents the day number. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- `input.txt`: The input data provided for the challenge.
- `part1.js`: JavaScript file containing the solution to part one of the challenge.
- `part2.js`: JavaScript file containing the solution to part two of the challenge.


## Running the Solutions

To run any solution, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, navigate to the respective day's folder and execute the solution file using Node.js. For example:

```bash
cd day-01
node part1.js
